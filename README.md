# ZK SNARK  

This provides an overview of a custom zero-knowledge circuit implemented using the Circom language. The circuit, named `CustomCircuit`, demonstrates the creation of logic gates and their connections to create a custom computation. The resulting circuit can be used to generate zero-knowledge proofs for certain computations while keeping the input values private.

## Circuit Overview

The `CustomCircuit` demonstrates the use of logic gates to compute an output signal based on input signals. The circuit involves the following components:

- **Inputs**: The circuit takes two input signals, `A` and `B`, which serve as operands for the computation.
- **Gates**: The circuit uses three logic gates: `AND`, `NOT`, and `OR`. These gates are defined as separate templates.
- **Intermediate Signals**: The circuit has two intermediate signals, `X` and `Y`, which are the outputs of the `AND` and `NOT` gates, respectively.
- **Output**: The final output signal, `Q`, is computed using the `OR` gate with inputs from the intermediate signals.
## Quick Start
Compile the Multiplier2() circuit and verify it against a smart contract verifier

```
pragma circom 2.0.0;

/*This circuit template checks that c is the multiplication of a and b.*/  

template CustomCircuit () {  

   // Declaration of signals.  
   signal input a;  
   signal input b;  
   signal output c;  

   // Constraints.  
   c <== a * b;  
}
component main = CustomCircuit();
```
### Install
`npm i`

### Compile
`npx hardhat circom` 
This will generate the **out** file with circuit intermediaries and geneate the **CustomCircuitVerifier.sol** contract

### Generate a proof and deploy a verifier contract using the provided script:
   Deploying on Local Hardhat Network
   ```
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
   ```
   Deploying on Mumbai Test Network
   ```
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network amoy
   ```
   This script performs the following tasks:
   - Deploys the verifier contract.
   - Generates a proof using circuit intermediaries.
   - Generates calldata for verification.
   - Calls `verifyProof()` on the verifier contract with calldata for proof verification.


With two commands you can compile a ZKP, generate a proof, deploy a verifier, and verify the proof 🎉

## Configuration
### Directory Structure
**circuits**
```
├── CustomCircuit
│   ├── circuit.circom
│   ├── input.json
│   └── out
│       ├── circuit.wasm
│       ├── CustomCircuit.r1cs
│       ├── CustomCircuit.vkey
│       └── CustomCircuit.zkey
├── new-circuit
└── powersOfTau28_hez_final_12.ptau
```
Each new circuit lives in it's own directory. At the top level of each circuit directory lives the circom circuit and input to the circuit.
The **out** directory will be autogenerated and store the compiled outputs, keys, and proofs. The Powers of Tau file comes from the Polygon Hermez ceremony, which saves time by not needing a new ceremony. 


**contracts**
```
contracts
└── CustomCircuitVerifier.sol
```
Verifier contracts are autogenerated and prefixed by the circuit name, in this example **CustomCircuit**

## hardhat.config.ts
```
  circom: {
    // (optional) Base path for input files, defaults to `./circuits/`
    inputBasePath: "./circuits",
    // (required) The final ptau file, relative to inputBasePath, from a Phase 1 ceremony
    ptau: "powersOfTau28_hez_final_12.ptau",
    // (required) Each object in this array refers to a separate circuit
    circuits: JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(circuits))
  },
```
### circuits.config.json
circuits configuation is separated from hardhat.config.ts for **autogenerated** purposes (see next section)
```
